# jenkins
a silly program to demonstrate dictionaries in C#.net

1. Open Visual Studio (Or MonoDevelop!)
2. Start new project. Make it a console application.
3. Paste this code into your screen, replacing ALL boilerplate code.
4. Build and run!

Make sure you check what the program is doing. It is sparsely commented, but it is laid out in such a way that it should be relatively easy for a new C# programmer to figure it out.
